# handSignGame
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game for me to get familiar with programming in python

Packages needed:
PyMongo,
Matplotlib

Also will need to install mongodb-community on your system.
This can be installed through homebrew tap (https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew)

to run the server:
brew services start mongodb-community@4.2 / brew services start mongodb-community

to stop the server:
brew services stop mongodb-community@4.2 / brew services stop mongodb-community

I will eventually make it into a virtual environment so the Packages are easier to manage.
